# How to add extra info to a hotel

## Considerations
  
It is an incremental load, so bear in mind these considerations:
    
* If a hotel info exists then it is updated.

* If a hotel info does not exist then it is created.

* Existing hotel info that are not referenced are not removed.

* If an existing hotel info has to be removed from system then you have to contact with TravelgateX.

* If there is any problem with a hotel's information then it is omitted (and logged) but the load continues.

</br>

## Specifications

* File name: **`Master_HotelInfo`**.

* Each line represents a resource for a hotel.

* The first line is a header line: it does not contain data directly and it will be skipped.

* Inside a line, by default fields are separated using the character `#`. This character can't be used inside data because fields would be gathered in a wrong way. *There is an exception, the resource value can contain the character "#" and it all will be gathered correctly.*

* The data of the fields is not encapsulated by `"` or any other character: the information must be included directly.

* Any blank line will be skipped.

* The file and its data have to be encoded using **UTF-8**. Otherwise there can be stored strange characters.

* If a field is mandatory then it has to be present in each line, even if it has no data: its used position cannot be omitted. If mandatory then we have to see if its data is mandatory or not.

* If a field is not mandatory but we want to set it then all previous fields must be present: if any previous field is not mandatory and we don't want to set a value we will have to include it with no value. We need it this way as it is used the field position to map it to the target data.

* If a field's data is not mandatory and we don't want to set it then we just keep it empty: i.e. ...||...

* If a field's data is mandatory then we have to set something (no value is not admitted).
